## Bloc Jams - Turn the Music Up!

![](http://www.gtgraves.net/img/landing.png)

Bloc Jams is a web based music player built with JavaScript and jQuery. This project was built by me with the assistance of my mentor at [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io/).

There are two different builds of this project.  This build utilizes primarily basic JavaScript.  A build utilizing AngularJS can be found [here](https://github.com/gtgraves/bloc-jams-angular).
